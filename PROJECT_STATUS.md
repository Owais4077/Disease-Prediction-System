### 🌐 How to Use

#### Quick Start:
1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python run_server.py
   ```
   Or on Windows: double-click `start_server.bat`

2. **Access the application**:
   - Open browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. **Make predictions**:
   - Select symptoms from the comprehensive list
   - Choose ML model (Random Forest recommended)
   - Click "Predict Disease"
   - View results with confidence scores

#### Advanced Usage:
- **Admin Panel**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- **Prediction History**: Track your previous predictions
- **About Page**: Learn about the system and models

### 📈 Sample Predictions Tested
1. **Common Cold**: continuous_sneezing, runny_nose, cough → Correctly identified
2. **Skin Issues**: itching, skin_rash, red_spots → Fungal infection (23.5% confidence)
3. **Fever Symptoms**: high_fever, headache, muscle_pain → Multiple possibilities identified
4. **Digestive Issues**: vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal_pain → Gastroenteritis/Malaria

### ⚠️ Important Notes
